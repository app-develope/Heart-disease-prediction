<p style="font-size:20px;"> Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death worldwide over the last few decades in the developed as well as underdeveloped and developing countries. Early detection of cardiac diseases can reduce the mortality rate.
<br><br>
One such cardiovascular disease is the Coronary Artery Disease(CAD).<br>
This is caused by plaque buildup in the wall of the arteries that supply blood to the heart (called coronary arteries). Plaque is made up of cholesterol deposits. Plaque buildup causes the inside of the arteries to narrow over time.
